# JiraTree
<h2> State of the art Agile Management Environment. </h2>

<h3> Installation </h3>

To install, first download the Cockroach DB through ccloud. 

<h3> Mac </h3>

Install [ccloud](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/quickstart.html?filters=ccloud#install-ccloud) using Homebrew

Once installed, on the same terminal session: 

```
ccloud quickstart
```

This will prompt you to create an account in Cockroach labs. Once you have created the account, close the tab. 

<h3> Windows </h3>

Install [ccloud](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/quickstart.html?filters=ccloud&filters=windows&#install-ccloud) using the powershell command

Once installed, on the same powerhell session:

```
ccloud quickstart
```

This will prompt you to create an account in Cockroach labs. Once you have created the account, close the tab. 

Once logged into cockroachdb using any OS, please send an email to utkarshlal@gmail.com and we will add you to the project as soon as possible. Once you are added to the project, you will be able to use our database functions locally. Since we are not deploying our website, we need to follow this cumbersome step.

<h3> Git clone and running locally </h3>

On the directory where you wish to run the program: 
```
git clone https://github.com/yashk0thari/JiraTree.git
cd JiraTree
code .
```

This opens the code in Visual Studio Code. Now open a VSC terminal and type 
```
npm run run
```
This would run the program on http://localhost:8080/

Play around and have fun using JiraTree :)
